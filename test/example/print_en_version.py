** That will print:

To Rimi, by Sandmeyer
Graceful beyond the simplicity of code,
Lively just like the exquisiteness of an algorithm.
As comments light up the meaning of code,
Your smile endows the color of life to me.
Like a function with a definite goal,
Your gaze leads the direction of my heart.
In love, I seek logic,
And you are the most beautiful rule.
Mistakes are no longer terrifying in front of you,
Because your tolerance is like the patience in debugging.
Just like a loop, love never stops,
Accompanying with you is my eternal pursuit.
Rimi, you are the code of my soul,
Compiled with love, never with errors.
May our story be like an open-source project,
Sharing beauty and always remembered.
